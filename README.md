2. Clone the following repository to local: [darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/edit/master/README.md)
3. Modify the Makefile to make following changes:
  * `GPU=1`
  * `CUDNN=1`
  * `OPENCV=1`
  * `LIBSO=1`
4. Do `make` in the darknet directory.

If no errors popped up, then darknet has been compiled successfully. If you see error messages, please review the

#### How to use the pedestrians detection
1. Clone this repository to local.
2. Copy four python files to the darknet directory, remember to replace the orginal darkne.py file.
3. Creat an input folder and an output folder
4. Do `python runAll.py --data_path <your input folder path> --save_path <your output folder path>` in the darknet
  directory.

If `python` is not pointing to a python (>=3.0), you may get `ImportError: No module named 'queue'`. Modify runAll.py
and change `python` to `python3`
